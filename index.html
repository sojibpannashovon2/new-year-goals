              <p>To do that, I've found six concepts helpful to think about in the wake of a failure. They make it easier to learn from, cope with, and bounce back from any failure.</p>
              <ul>
                <li> Your failure may be because you were too earlyâ€¦or too late.</li>
                <li>Was it a failure of expectations or execution?</li>
                <li>There are successes to be found in every failure if you look for them.</li>
                <li>Are you failing at the right things?</li>
